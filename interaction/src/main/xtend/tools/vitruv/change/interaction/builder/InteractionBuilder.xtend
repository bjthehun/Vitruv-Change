/**
 * Interface for functionality relevant to all types of dialog builders.<br>
 * <br>
 * DialogBuilder rationale:<br>
 * For each type of dialog, there is a builder (...DialogBuilderImpl) implementing a ...DialogBuilder interface and
 * extending BaseDialogBuilder which provides methods to specify dialog properties common to all types of dialogs. To
 * ensure that mandatory properties are set via the builder before the dialog is being built and shown, the
 * ...DialogBuilder interfaces only declare one (mandatory) method, which then either returns further (inner) interfaces
 * representing further mandatory steps on the builder the same way, or an OptionalSteps interface, which contains
 * non-mandatory build steps as well as the common ones from the {@link DialogBuilder} interface and the method to build
 * and display the dialog as well as get the user input (if any). A ...DialogBuilderImpl implements all inner interfaces
 * of its ...DialogBuilder interface to enable using it for all build steps. This is a form of a fluent Step Builder.
 * 
 * @param <V> the return type for the user input.
 * @param <T> type parameter for the return type of methods whose execution is optional when building a dialog. This
 *      makes it possible to reuse one implementation of the common methods declared here across multiple dialog
 *      builders. The type passed in has to implement this interface to ensure access to the methods declared here.
